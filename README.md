# Naschkatze
A Minecraft Mod  

The mod has a creative tab for all it's stuff.  
The survival additions right now are:  
- Copper Ore  
- Copper Ingot (smelt ore)  
- Copper Block (9 ingots in the crafting table)  
- Copper Wire (3 copper ingots in a line)  
- Copper Coil (8 copper wire in a chest-like pattern with one wooden plank in the middle)  

When you redstone power a coil, it will make all compasses point to it if they are within a 3 block radius of the coil.  
If you are in range of multiple powered coils, compass will point to the first coil placed.  
TODO: make it point at closest coil  

### Special Thanks
This mod would not be possible without the patitence and constant assistance of many people from the #minecraftforge IRC.  
Here are named some to whom I owe most of my current understanding of forge, minecraft source code and modding in general:

#### IRC best moments
```
<Ordinastie_> because to be honest, you clearly lack programming knowledge to do something better optimised  
  
<diesieben07> do you know what the word "instance" means?  
  
<RANKSHANK> probably the first thing you should learn is how to use your ide  
  
<diesieben07> jesus man, use your IDE  
  
<ghz|afk> keep in mind scanning for entities is slow  
<ghz|afk> so you may want to throttle it a bit  
<secknv> so what is the best of knowing when a player is within 3 blocks of my block  
<ghz|afk> williewillus told you  
<ghz|afk> there's methods in world, for scanning  
<secknv> but you said it's slow  
<ghz|afk> yes  
<secknv> slow is not best :\  
<ghz|afk> but you have limited java knowledge  
<secknv> i cry  
```
